# Contentful Hello World

## 📝 Description

This is a simple project that connects to **Contentful** (a headless CMS) and retrieves content using its SDK directly from the browser.  
It is built only with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks).

The app dynamically loads and displays a message stored in Contentful, simulating a headless architecture (content separated from design).
